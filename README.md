# Dab's Modded Server Jars
the .jar files for all the mods i have on my modded server  
if you're a mod dev and want credit, message me on discord (DaBigF5#1987)  
i'm sorry i can't include all the credits but there's so many that it would just be too difficult  
  
## Instructions
1. clone the directory to your PC
2. extract DabModdedServerJars-main.zip
3. put the .jar files into your `.minecraft/mods/` directory (if you're on windows you can find it by pressing windows key+r and then typing in `%appdata%/.minecraft`)
4. delete the README.md file
